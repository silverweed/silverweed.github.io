Lifish is an upcoming arcade game for PC, Mac and Linux (and BSD too, why not?).

Fight the menace of an alien invasion, be a hero and save the Earth, kicking some butts in the process.
Oh, you can bring your buddy too if you feel lonely.

Clear many different areas from the enemy, beat terrible Bosses, drive aliens straight out of their lair,
get more and more powerful through powerups and loot treasure. Just...don't die, please. Earth has a reputation
to keep.

Release date for the game is still unknown, but you can track the development progress [here](/lifish-status).
