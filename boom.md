BOOM was a [shareware game for MacOS](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/3582-boom) created by Federico Filipponi (FactorSoftware). The game's slogan was "Bomberman meets DOOM": you could play solo or in local coop throughout 80 levels, facing a plethora of different enemies, intermediate bosses and a final Big Alien Boss.

Unfortunately, the game's original site is not accessible anymore, so BOOM can only be downloaded from archives found on the Internet.

I played BOOM a lot, since when I was a kid, and it is the game that made me venture on the game developing path. Maybe, if it weren't for that game, I wouldn't be developing games at all nowadays. 

For this reason, in 2015 I decided to start working on a complete remake for the game. That project would eventually become [Lifish](/lifish/). But alas, making a game is hard and takes a lot of time, so Lifish still isn't complete yet. 

However, as most of the code is there, I figured in the meantime I could work on a mod that, changing a bit of gameplay logic and borrowing assets from the original game, could effectively become a faithful remake of BOOM! So there it is, a game as close to the original Factor Software's BOOM, playable on Windows, Mac and Linux completely for free!

<p class='discl'><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: all graphics and audio assets in the game belong to Factor Software. This game is a remake distributed free of charge with the aim to preserve the original game from obsolescence.
