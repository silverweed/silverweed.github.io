Due to an oversight, the builds of *BOOM: Remake 1.8.2*, except the Windows version, were missing the levels file. I uploaded [new builds](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/#downloads) which fix this mistake, so if you downloaded the game yesterday (4 November 2024), please download the new build of the game to get back the missing levels!
Unfortunately, having tested the new build only on Windows this time, I didn't catch the issue until I was told about it by a player.
Sorry for the inconvenience!
