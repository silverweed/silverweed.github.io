Greetings, Reader!

I have been thinking to start a blog for quite some time now, and today I'm finally taking this on.

More specifically, this is my *development* blog, as the main focus will be on the
games I am and I will be working on.

I hope I'll be able to provide some interesting bits on what I've learned so far on video game programming
and developing. I'm not a professional developer--much less a professional blogger-- but I'm willing to share
what I've learned in my years of fiddling with this stuff to anyone interested.

I will also post--somewhat regularly-- updates on the video game I've been working on for about 2 years, named
*Lifish*, which I'm programming "from scratch" in C++, as well as occasional programming-related stuff.

So, if video games and/or programming is your thing, stay tuned for updates! ;-)

## About me
I am (as of 2017) a 25 year old guy from Italy who is currently studying Computer Science, with a special focus
in video game programming.

My first "serious attempt" at making a video game dates back around 2010, so I'm pretty newbie in the business;
however, I consider myself an enthusiastic programmer and a quick learner, and I've been pretty busy at learning
during all these years.

Most of my works are [on Github](https://github.com/silverweed), should you be interested, although most projects are
incomplete to say the least.
Lifish is currently my best effort at creating something worth playing, so it's what this blog will mostly focus on.

More detailed stuff about it is coming: subscribe to the Feed to get updates as soon as they arrive!

<small>(Footnote: "silverweed" has nothing to do with smoking weed: the name is from a character of my favourite book:
Watership Down by R. Adams. It's funny, since I've never smoked in my life :-)</small>
