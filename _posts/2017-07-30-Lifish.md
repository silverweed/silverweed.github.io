With all the delay that fits my ever-procrastinating being, it's about time I start talking about my current **main project**.

It is a videogame called _Lifish_, which I've been working on for about 2 years now. Time sure flies when development
times are involved.

### BOOM ###
Before talking about _Lifish_, though, I need to mention its spiritual ancestor: _BOOM_ by Federico Filipponi.
_BOOM_ is an arcade videogame with the tagline "Bomberman meets DOOM", which is pretty accurate in retrospective.
I say "in retrospective" because the first time I played it I had no idea what either Bomberman or DOOM were, as I
was probably about 10 at the time.

I'd really like to give you a download link to the game, but recently the
developer's site got down, likely forever, as the game is pretty old. You can still find some screenshots on the
Internet though:

As the image shows, _BOOM_ is a grid-based multiplayer game, where players must defeat all the enemies
in the stage to advance to the next level. With bombs. You can find powerups in the walls, must defeat bosses every
10 levels and so on. Pretty classic, and damn fun and challenging.

### Lifish ###
Basically, Lifish was born as an attempt to re-create _BOOM_ from scratch, making it possible to play not only on
Mac (like the original game), but also on Linux, Windows and so on. It was also the realization of a dream, as when I
played it as a child I always wondered what sort of magic was needed to craft a game like that.

So, in summer 2015 I fired up Vim and started coding. My language of choice was (*sigh*) C++, both because it's
the language I'm more familiar with and because I wanted to improve my skills with it. After all, one never truly *knows* C++.
Also, the choice out there is pretty limited when talking about multimedia libraries.

Two years later, I can easily say it was REALLY. SUPER. USEFUL. on that perspective. I have now a clear idea of
things I didn't really get at that time, like the concept of ownership, memory safety, the use of smart pointers
and also some bits of metaprogramming (videos of CppCon and tips from a friend were also very illuminating on the subject).

But more on that will come in future posts.

Right now, suffices to say that:  
	1. I managed in my intent to re-create an almost-exact clone of BOOM. That's the `0.x` version of Lifish, which
	   you can find [here](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish/releases/tag/0.x) (instructions on how to install
	   are [here](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish/issues/3#issuecomment-279984296)), so if you wish to play
	   _BOOM_ in 2017 you can pretty much do it <small>(ahem, the final boss is missing though)</small>.  
	2. I wasn't satisfied with the result, mainly because the code was pretty ugly and non-modular. Therefore I
	   decided to pretty much restart from scratch (I initially called it a 'refactor', but in the end I threw away
	   most of the code). That's the `1.x` version of Lifish, which is [currently under development](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish).
	   This version is a game similar to _BOOM_ but with several differences and improvements, and
	   I will speak more about it in future posts.  

I can't show you any meaningful screenshots yet, as the game art has yet to be done, but the gameplay is in a very
advanced state, and I hope I'll be able to release it soon enough<sup>TM</sup>.
