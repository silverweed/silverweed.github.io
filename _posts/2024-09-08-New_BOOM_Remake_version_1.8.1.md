A new *BOOM: Remake* version is out: 1.8.1.

This update fixes a regression introduced in 1.8.0 that can prevent the game to be saved correctly. If you are on version 1.8.0 you are highly recommended to update the game if you want to avoid bad surprises!

Thanks for [@orazioedoardo](https://github.com/orazioedoardo) for the fix!

As usual you can grab the update [here](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/#downloads).
