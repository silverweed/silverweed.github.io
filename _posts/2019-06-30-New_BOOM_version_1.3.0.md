Patch 1.3.0 for *BOOM: Remake* is up! You can find the new version [at the download page](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/).

This update comes with several important bug fixes that made the game much harder to finish than intended: namely, save files and some occasional crashes/softlocks.

Other than that, the Teleporters' behaviour has been reworked a bit to make it more faithful to the original BOOM.

Shouts out to the user Benji for reporting all these bugs! Sorry if it took a bit longer than I anticipated to fix (most of) them, but they should be gone for good now :-)

A couple of yet-to-be-fixed issues now consist in the Mean O' Taur AI and probably more tweaking on the Teleporters. I hope I can get those fixes as well within a reasonable time frame :-)
