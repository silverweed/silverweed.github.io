A new patch of BOOM: Remake is up! There is a small yet convenient change: preferences are now "remembered" by the
game, so you don't have to set them again from one play to the next one.

Also, if you specify a custom level set (passing an argument to the executable via the command line) and that level set
does not exist, the game will land on an explicative error page rather than simply crashing.

You can find the new version [at the usual page](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/).
