A new version of *BOOM: Remake* is out: 1.6!

This has a bunch of fixes to bugs that were mostly reported by players (thanks to all of you!) as well as some tweaks to the gameplay to bring it even closer to the original game.

Unfortunately, there is also a sad piece of news: due to me no longer having access to an Apple computer, I won't be addressing OSX-specific bugs nor create new releases for OSX in the foreseeable future. The OSX version of the game will remain frozen to 1.5.3 for the time being. Apologies to Apple users for that. If you wish to play the latest version, you can always [download the source code](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish) and compile the game yourself: the process is described in the README.md file. I know it's not great, but there's not much else I can do about it right now. Hopefully I'll eventually be able to resume updating the OSX version as well.

For everyone else, the download links are [at the usual place](https://silverweed.github.io/boom). Happy bombing!
