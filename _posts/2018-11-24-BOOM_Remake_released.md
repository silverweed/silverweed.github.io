Hello, I'm not dead! The lack of updates recently is mostly due to me graduating and starting a new job as
a Junior Gameplay Programmer. It's a super neat job, but of course it comes with a hard strike to my free time and
I have yet to settle into my new daily schedule :-)

However, I have good news! I've been working on modding parts of Lifish in order to get a fully working BOOM remake,
and I'm glad to announce the first release is here!

In the likely case you don't know, BOOM was a shareware MacOS game that inspired me to create [Lifish](/lifish).
The original site hosting the BOOM downloads has recently gone down, probably for good, so I decided to extract
all assets from BOOM and put them into a modded version of Lifish. The result is a fully playable faithful remake
of BOOM! If you're interested in playing it, [go straight to the download page](/boom/) and play it 100% free on
Windows, Mac or Linux!

I couldn't thoroughly test from start to end, so should you find any bug, please let me know in the comments.

Enjoy!
