A new version of *BOOM: Remake* is available!

This version fixes a long-standing bug that made the player able to "dodge" bullet damage in some cases. This was due to an inconsistency between the relative coordinates of the player and the bullet hitbox as calculated by the collision detector and by the player itself, which would sometimes differ by a single pixel. Shouts out for the players who kindly reported this and other bugs in the past few months!

There is still a known issue with the Linux packaged build which doesn't work for some players, but unfortunately that fix will have to wait until the next patch.

Meanwhile, [here are the download links](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/#downloads): happy bombing!
