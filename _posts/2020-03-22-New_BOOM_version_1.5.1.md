(Happy new year!)

A new version of *BOOM: Remake* is out: 1.5.1. 

This is a minor release fixing game saving that would fail when the saves directory is missing (thanks Mark for reporting it!).

Moreover, for stability reasons, I gave up on MinGW and started building the game with MSVC on Windows, since it now properly supports C++14 - which wasn't the case when I started *Lifish*.

You can find the new version [at the download page](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/).
