A (long overdue) new patch for *BOOM: Remake* is out: version 1.5.3.

This fixes a couple of bugs kindly reported by some players, such as enemies never changing direction when entering a teleporter or still being able to to their yell while morphed into aliens.

It also introduces high scores! This change was actually implemented, ahem, *a while ago*, but I haven't got myself to properly test it and rebuild the game for all platforms until now. Better late than never I guess!

 Go straight [to the download page](https://silverweed.github.io/boom/) to enjoy the new version and as always don't hesitate to report any bugs you might find (just keep in mind it might take an indeterminate amount of time to fix them, depending on my free time and situation).

Good bombing!
