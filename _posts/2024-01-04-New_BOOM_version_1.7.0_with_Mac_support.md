Hey there!

2024 opens with good news for all *BOOM: Remake* Mac players: new version 1.7.0 reintroduces (partial) support for OSX!
Thanks to the [kind contribution](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish/pull/20) by [orazioedoardo](https://github.com/orazioedoardo), *BOOM: Remake* now works again on the newest OSX versions.

The support is "partial" because I cannot test the OSX version personally, so I can only rely on Mac players' feedback about it working or not.
Nevertheless, if you're on Mac and missed playing the latest version of the game, [go give it a shot](https://silverweed.github.io/boom) and feel free to give your feedback, either on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/silverweed/lifish) or [github](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish).

Happy new year and, as always, happy bombing :-)
