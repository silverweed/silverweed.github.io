A new version of BOOM Remake (1.2.2) is up! This version fixes various bugs and adds the possibility to play solo. Moreover, several parameters were tweaked to make the game more similar to the original BOOM.
Note that now the game starts in 1-player mode by default. To change that, go to Preferences -> Players and change it to 2.

Go grab it [at the downloads page](/boom#downloads)!

P.S. The downloads page now also features a changelog to keep track of the various versions. If you find a bug in the game please ensure you're on the latest version :-)
