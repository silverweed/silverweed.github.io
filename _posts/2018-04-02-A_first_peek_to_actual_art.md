Today's post is a bit special: I can at last show you a teensy bit of the actual, not-made-by-me-in-GIMP art
that'll be part of Lifish! Of course, something *may* still differ in the release version, but this is much
more representative of what you can expect the game to look like :-)

The player has been redesigned: it's still a humanoid bird, but much more badass and with the "Rambo-like" look
I wanted it to have since the beginning.
Thanks to the talented hand of Elisa, the artist collaborating with me to create Lifish
([go check out her work](https://www.behance.net/lisiri), it's super cool!),
our protagonist is now really ready to kick some alien asses. I mean, look at him!

In the latest months, Elisa's been working on concept art and animations to start giving the world of Lifish
a shape and we're starting to get a grasp on what it shall feel like.

As you can see, despite my not-exactly-regular updates, development is going on, slow but steady.
Unfortunately this game is a hobby project for the both of us, and we can't work on it full-time, but
we're determined to roll out a demo of the first ten-or-so levels within 2018 nonetheless :-)
As always, stay tuned for more updates!
